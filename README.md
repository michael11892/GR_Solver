# Overview
GR_Solver is a simple, single-file, script written using symbolic python that takes as input an arbitrary Metric Tensor and automatically calculates and outputs the Christoffel Pseudo-Tensor, Riemann Curvature Tensor, Ricci Tensor, Scalar Curvature and Kretschmann Scalar

## Instructions
The code does not require any form of setup, simply open the file and edit the initial value of the Metric Tensor (g) and the code will be ready to run!

Note: Right now, the defualt setting is the Schwarzschild Metric.
