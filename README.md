# Overview
GR_Solver is a simple, single-file, script written using symbolic python that takes as input an arbitrary Metric Tensor and automatically calculates and outputs the Christoffel Pseudo-Tensor, Riemann Curvature Tensor, Ricci Tensor, Scalar Curvature and Kretschmann Scalar

## Instructions
The **sympy** library is required to run the script. Other than that, the code does not require any additional form of setup, simply open the file, edit the  value of the Metric Tensor (g) and the code is ready to be run!

Note: Right now, the defualt setting is the Schwarzschild Metric.
